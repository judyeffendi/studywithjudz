                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    My name is Judy Effendi, I have my BS in Computer Science and have worked as a Software Engineer for Target for a year. I am passionate about technology and continuously seek to expand my knowledge and skills. In addition to my technical background, I am also preparing for a transition into the field of medicine, aiming to get accepted into medical school. This journey is driven by my desire to make a broader impact on people's lives through healthcare. I am developing this website as a way to document and track my journey from transitioning from tech to medicine while maintaining my skills in tech. I have a passion for helping others and believe I can make a big difference with my combined passion of medicine and tech. As I take this big leap of faith, I will be documenting my studying containing study guides, my learnings and reflections, study resources that I have found along my journey and my plan for taking and excelling in the MCAT prior to my application for Medical School in the Summer of 2026. I want to inspire others who might be scared to make a change in their career and life. As I am freshly graduated for about a year now, working as a Software Engineer for 11 months, I recognized I wasn't fulfilled in my work and the work I want to do didn't align with what I was doing. I have always been interested in how technology will shape the future of healthcare and allow for faster disease discoveries, cures, and ease into improving physicians day to day life. As a non-traditional pre-med student, I found that it is a little intimidating to make such a big switch. But, with the combined passion and dedication - anything is possible. I hope anyone who finds this website is inspired by risk and change.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I have always been a mentor and leader in CS outreach programs, which has allowed me to develop strong leadership skills. These skills are crucial in both the tech industry and in healthcare. Being a leader is very important for the patient and for the healthcare provider, ensuring that patients receive the best possible care and support.
