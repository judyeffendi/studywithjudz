# StudyWithJudz

Welcome to **StudyWithJudz**, a study tool website created by Judy Effendi. As a Computer Science graduate on the path to medical school, I'm documenting my study journey, resources, and MCAT preparation to share insights and tools that help me along the way.

## Introduction

My name is Judy Effendi, and I am a Computer Science graduate currently preparing for medical school. This website is a reflection of my study process, the resources I use, and my MCAT preparation journey. It aims to provide valuable resources and track my progress as I transition from software engineering to medicine.

## Study Page

The Study Page features a collection of resources and guides related to my study habits throughout my post-bacc program. Here, you'll find strategies and tools that I use to stay organized and productive in my studies.

## Resources

In the Resources section, you can find:
- Music that helps me stay calm and focused
- Links to helpful pages and tools
- A clock to help track and manage my study time effectively

## MCAT

The MCAT section includes my study schedule and progress tracking. It's designed to help me stay accountable and monitor my preparation journey for the MCAT.
